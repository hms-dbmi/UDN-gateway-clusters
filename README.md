# UDN-analysis
Jupyter Notebook for conducting analysis on UDN data and creation and analysis of clusters

## Clusters
The clusters are computed with a non deterministic algorithm. To have the exact clusters analyzed in the paper, and if you have approved access to the data, I can forward the associated file.

## Prerequisites
The following libraries must be installed: 
```bash
numpy
scipy
matplotlib
seaborn
community
networkx
collections
os
xml.etree.ElementTree
PicSureHpdsLib
PicSureClient
operator
pandas
```

Here are the repo links to [PicSureHpdsLib](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-python-adapter-hpds) and [PicSureClient](https://github.com/hms-dbmi/pic-sure-python-client)
## Authorizations
To have access to the UDN data, you will need IRB approval. When it is the case, you will need a token to log into the database, to add in the PicSureClient to connect.

## How to
The jupyter notebook Data_analysis_UDN comprises all the code used for analyses of the UDN database.
